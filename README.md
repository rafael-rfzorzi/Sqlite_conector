# Sqlite_conector
Class that simplifies the act of connecting and disconnecting from the sqlite file base

Add the Bind_Connectors.py file to your project or copy the class along with "import sqlite"

Use the class variable "self.database_sql" to assign the sqlite file path, for example: "self.database_sql = 'c:\test\test.db'"
